# JavaScript Homeworks from Class 1

## Section - Intro to Programming

### 1. The Fortune Teller
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

* Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
* Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

### 2. The Age Calculator
Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!

* Store the current year in a variable.
* Store their birth year in a variable.
* Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
* Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.

### 3. The Temperature Converter
Let's make a program to convert celsius tempatures to fahrenheit and vice versa, so we can complain about the weather with our friends oversees.

**Reminder**: To convert celsius to fahrenheit, multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32. To convert fahrenheit to celsius, deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9.

**Unicode Characters**: To print the degrees symbol in JavaScript, we need to use the write `\u00B0` to represent the unicode character for the degress symbol.

* Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
* Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
* Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
* Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."

### Challenge Question: Using Math functions
JavaScript has a built-in tool that can generate a random number between 0 and 1. This tool is called a ***method***. We'll talk about methods more later in the class. For now, know if you type `Math.random()`, you'll get a random number between 0 and 1.

Using this tool, update your fahrenheit to celsius tempature conversion program to do the following:

* Instead of inputing a value for the Fahrenheit tempature, use Math.random() to generate a random tempature between 0 and 100
* Have to program output: "It is NN°F today. That's NN°C."
